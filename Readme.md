Every multiplayer project needs to run the game code on the backend side.
<a href="https://github.com/anthill-platform/anthill-game">Game Service</a>
perfectly does that task. But sometimes you don't need that kind
of complicity and just to want a simple script that players can connect to
and do things here and there. In Javascript!

The service uses Git to host your code on, so you can setup a repository, put
your javascript there, configure it on the service, and you're all set.
